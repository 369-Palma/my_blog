**Context**

This report has been produced by a team of Wageningen University master students as an Academic
and Consultancy Training (ACT) project. This multidisciplinary group of students has been
commissioned by the WINK (Waardevolle Informatie Natuurgedreven Kwaliteit) consortium. The WINK
is a group of experts, scientists and farmers who have been commissioned by the Dutch ministry of
Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality (LNV) to create a tool for new and existing farmers who are
starting the journey towards natuurlijke landbouw, the Dutch term that literally translates to **‘natural agriculture’** . The WINK understands this concept of natuurlijke landbouw as an expression of nature-
inclusive farming. Nature-inclusive farming is characterized as an umbrella term representing food

production systems that integrate sustainable natural resource management practices in an efficient
and mutually-beneficial manner. The WINK consortium proposes the promotion of natuurlijke
landbouw as a potential remedy to the current ecological plight felt in the Netherlands, to which the
ongoing intensification trend of modern agriculture has contributed.

As a piece of this larger effort, the team set out to accomplish two goals and corresponding methods:
1. To explore the broader concept of nature-inclusive farming and to then establish an
unambiguous definition of the relatively new Dutch term natuurlijke landbouw. A comparative
literature study was performed to define nature-inclusive farming and nature farming via WUR
library research.

2. To analyze the development of four existing Dutch nature-inclusive farms (Herenboeren
Wilhelminapark, Roggebotstaete, de Regte Heide, and Boeren in het Bos). This was
accomplished by conducting a semi-structured in-depth interview design following the
guidelines established by Emans (2004) and questions were based on the critical incident
theory (Flanagan, 1954). Transcriptions of these interviews were processed into the following
parts: a general farm description in the form of a biography; a timeline with critical incidents
(significant turning points); a list of learning points extracted from the critical incidents; and a
list of indicators used by farmers to assess performance. Indicators were deduced both by
using the plain text of the interview transcripts and by using open and axial codes based on
grounded theory (Corbin and Strauss, 1990). The SAFA sustainability framework (FAO, 2013)
was referenced in the description of indicators. The indicators were then placed into
environmental, social and economic perspectives using the People, Planet, Profit (PPP)
framework.
We present the findings of our investigation in the following academic report. Embedded within the
report are materials for use in the WINK’s future comprehensive ‘travel guide’ for existing and aspiring
nature-inclusive farmers and natuurlijke landbouw practitioners. Such materials (including case studies
and corresponding timelines, learning points, advice, and performance indicators) were created with
the intention of use in a future handbook for farmers. Furthermore, the report includes insight into
the scientific and academic process and a comprehensive discussion. These are especially created for
the project commissioner, academic advisor, coach or other readers taking an interest in the academic
approach to accomplishing our goals.

**A summary of findings**


Definition of natuurlijke landbouw
**Natuurlijke landbouw** is a type of nature-inclusive farming wherein nature is as completely as possible
integrated with food, feed and fibre production. Nature and biodiversity are the main focus and are at
the foundation of this type of farming.
Inspiration for production is drawn from ecological principles
and is not harmful to nature. Cycles are as closed as is realizable with the help of a diversity of land
uses and smart utilization of natural resources. Energy use is efficient and as low as possible. It excludes
the usage of artificial fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides, antibiotics and genetically modified organisms.
Common learning points
The context dependency of each farm story poses a challenge for outlining common learning points,
however the following learning points were observed on multiple farms:
Learn from the past and make realistic calculations for a viable business plan.
Be flexible in approach to external factors and bottlenecks that may appear on which you have
few or no influence.
It’s not always possible to follow the regulations created for conventional systems; be creative
and find a way to achieve your goals.
Be transparent to create understanding and gain trust from the consumers and the outside
world.
Trial and error is inevitable, but try to investigate all involved factors first before you start with
big investments.

**Co-production**: Involve different stakeholders in your journey of production and share the
enthusiasm about your vision.
Build a network of people, organisations and enterprises that support you as a farmer and your
enterprise.

**Crowdfunding** can be an effective way to finance specific goals and to involve others in in your
project.
When renting out properties, establish a clear agreement on expected standards and a
monitoring system.

Get inspiration from participating in **workshops**, **courses** and **round table discussion** with other
farmers.

**Involve the community** in the transition of the farm towards becoming more nature inclusive.


**Common indicators**
The farm performance indicators from each farm were assembled into a comprehensive list of
indicators, and compared to those that were identified by the WINK. Indicators that stood out in the
**people dimension** included ‘Level of engagement with stakeholders’, ‘Mental and physical health’,
‘Conflict resolution’ and ‘Level of influence on the Dutch laws and legislation’.

Prominent **planet indicators** included ‘Nature conservation’ and ‘Animal welfare’. In the **profit dimension**, the indicators
that stood out included ‘Financial independence’ and ‘Net cash flow’.
In addition to those commonly used indicators that specifically categorized to PPP dimensions, some **general indicators** were selected
that not belong to any level of PPP but cover more than one domain. Examples of those indicators are:
‘Function diversity’, ‘Complexity of the system’ and ‘Stability of production’.
So far, there is no single summary of indicators for nature-inclusive farms yet. We have taken the first
step to develop the initial list of indicators based on the four nature-inclusive farms case studies in the
Netherlands. The list of indicators we developed can be further expanded by future research, which
integrates literature with the views of different stakeholders involved in the nature-inclusive farming
movement.
